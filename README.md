# useful unity scripts

here i dump all of my `.cs` scripts that i use fairly often, such as basic animation handlers, settings, and maybe even some GUI tools. feel free to copy any of those into your project, or contribute too if you want.

these scripts are mainly just drag-n-drop files that are meant for ultra-basic tasks, that are required for pretty much any project, but takes time to implement into the project.

repo is new, and its not like i work on a new unity project every week (and i wish i was, trust me), so it would take a longg time for something actually useful to appear.
